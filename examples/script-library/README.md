# Editable scripting reference library

These style references include original fictional demonstrations and attributed short excerpts from user-supplied transcripts. They guide new topic-generated dialogue and Studio's **Auto-direct delivery** pass. They are reference material in the prompt, not model fine-tuning or verified factual sources. Imported scripts keep their wording unless you explicitly request a rewrite; delivery-only passes may change bracket cues, never spoken words.

`zh-00-talk168-user-excerpts.md` contains short references from all three Instagram transcripts you supplied, including the shift from light banter into a serious account in the third. Raw text and provenance are kept separately in `references/instagram/`. Audio delivery and speaker attribution have not been verified. This file plus the three original Mandarin demonstrations occupy the four active Mandarin slots; edit/consolidate these files before adding more.

Edit the files here to refine the show's taste. Add short excerpts from your own approved scripts under names such as `zh-04-my-approved-conversation.md`. Use `zh-` for Mandarin and `en-` for English. The app reads up to four matching files in alphabetical order on every request, falling back to `en-` examples when that language has no examples. Each file must be under 6,000 characters. Replace or consolidate examples if the language already has four files.

A useful example contains a few turns, the interaction you want, and a short explanation of what to learn. Mark bad examples **Avoid** and good examples **Better**. Include varied openings, real follow-ups, corrections, uncertainty, brief reactions, different turn lengths, restrained delivery, and endings that do not sound like a speech. Avoid filling the library with only jokes or only fact-dumping interviews.

Use fictional situations or clearly identified style-only excerpts. The writer must still check live sources for the actual episode. Do not put secrets or unrelated instructions here: the selected excerpts are sent to the configured Codex task.

## Uploaded video reference

In Studio's Script step, choose **Use reference style · Source-led explainer**. This sets the saved Style field and loads `profile-source-led-explainer.md` for new drafting, replacing the fourth regular excerpt within the four-reference budget. CLI/API clients can include `source-led explainer` in `styleNote`. The B-roll planner also receives this style and requests supporting visuals at attributed claims.

The profile records sampled visual observations and approximate local transcription of the user's 160.6-second reference. It emphasizes presenter-led chronology, short reactions, explicit attribution, and uncertainty. Actual article screenshots and event footage still require supplied assets. Source capture, highlighted article panels, and bilingual subtitle generation are not added by this profile.
